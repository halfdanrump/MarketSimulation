\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5}{\ignorespaces The HFT agent submits a sell order for 100 stocks, and another agent submits a price-matching buy order which fills the sell order. Before the transaction receipt reaches the seller, the seller decides to cancel the order, and submit another order at a different price. When the transaction receipt reaches the seller, the agent promptly sends out a cancellation of its second sell order, as it knows it cannot fulfill the order. However, before the cancellation reaches the market, a third agent fills the sell order, and a receipt is send to the seller who ends up being short.\relax }}{17}

The only point where it scores badly is the standard deviation which is slightly high due to the fluctuating trade price.\relax }}{33}
