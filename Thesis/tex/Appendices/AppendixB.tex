The model was implemented in Java, while data analysis and plotting was carried out in Python. All code made for this thesis can be downloaded from \url{https://github.com/halfdanrump/MarketSimulation}. The genetic algorithm was built using Deap \cite{rainville2012deap}, while using Scoop \cite{arslan2006scoop} for concurrency. \texttt{scikit}-learn \cite{pedregosa2011scikit} was used for clustering and other machine learning techniques. Numpy, Scipy and Pandas libraries \cite{van2011numpy, oliphant2006guide, jones2001scipy} were heavily utilized in the analysis and plotting, which was carried out using Matplotlib \cite{hunter2007matplotlib}.
