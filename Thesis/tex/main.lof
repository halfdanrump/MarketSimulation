Before the transaction receipt reaches the seller, the seller decides to cancel the order, and submit another order at a different price. When the transaction receipt reaches the seller, the agent promptly sends out a cancellation of its second sell order, as it knows it cannot fulfill the order. However, before the cancellation reaches the market, a third agent fills the sell order, and a receipt is send to the seller who ends up being short.\relax }}{11}{figure.caption.50}
