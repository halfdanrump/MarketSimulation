\chapter{Experiments}
As mentioned in the previous chapter, the process of finding was an iterative one of running an experiment, analyzing the generated data, draw conclusions and then repeat the steps with a new experiments designed to amend the mistakes of the previous experiment. This chapter will go through each of these steps and explain the insights that were gained.

Data set \dthree was the first run of the genetic algorithm that actually produced something that looked like results. The following parameters were included in the genetic algorithm individuals:
\begin{center}
\sclatencymu, \sclatencys, \scnAgents, \scthinkmu, \scthinks, \sctimehorizonmu, \sctimehorizons, \scwaitTimeBetweenTradingmu, \scwaitTimeBetweenTradings, \ssmmlatencymu, \ssmmlatencys, \ssmmnAgents, \ssmmthinkmu, \ssmmthinks
\end{center}

\section{D3}
In this experiment, the number of \ssmmnAgents and \scnAgents as well all the latency parameters were included in the individuals. The genetic algorithm was run for 1000 generations with a population size of 200. A total of
