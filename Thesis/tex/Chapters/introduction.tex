Many models of artificial markets resemble typical game theoretic models in that all trading is round based. Typically all agents receive the market information and evaluate their strategies once every round. Such models are very useful when all agents are more or less equally fast, since it is then reasonable to assume that they have access to the same information. 

The model proposed in this work is different from such models in that it assumes that agents generally do \textit{not} have access to the same information when they evaluate their strategies.
