Before proceeding to discuss the results of the various experiments, we will take a look at how the model behaves with some reasonably looking hand picked parameters. This is in order to illustrate the differences between the

\subsection{Fundamental price}
Four different scenarios for how the fundamental price behaves were implemented. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Flat fundamental
	\item Impulse
	\item Step function
	\item Ramp function
	\item Random walk (Geometric Brownian motion)
\end{enumerate}
The two first scenarios are rather trivial and would not occur in the real world, but since they are simple they are used to verify that the model does not behave in strange ways. The step function is useful, since it simulates a single shock to the fundamental price, such as the sudden arrival of some news. The purpose of a step function fundamental is to 

The ramp function simulates a market in which
